# Notes

This is a simple Notes application built with **React**. The app allows users to create, edit, and delete notes, with data stored in the browser using **localForage** for local storage management. It is a great tool for organizing quick notes or reminders.

## Features

- **Add New Notes**: Users can create new notes by filling in the title and content.
- **Edit Notes**: Users can edit the title and content of an existing note.
- **Delete Notes**: Users can delete any note they no longer need.
- **Local Storage**: The notes are saved to **localStorage** using `localForage`, meaning the notes persist even when the page is refreshed.
- **Date Formatting**: Each note has a date formatted using the helper function `getFormattedDate()`.
